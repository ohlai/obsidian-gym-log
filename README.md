There are three different views/pages:
- Overview / a list of workouts that have been performed. This includes a heatmap.
- A workout view. Includes a list of remaining and performed exercises. 
  - Has en effort graph at the bottom
- An exercise view that shows instructions and the last few times this exercise was performed.
  - Has en effort/weight graph at the bottom
